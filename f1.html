  const actions = ["Aggressive Overtake: Take a risky move to overtake the car in front. Roll a die: if the result is 4 or higher, you succeed and move ahead. If lower, you lose a position.",
"Defensive Maneuver: Block an opponent from overtaking you for one turn. This can only be used once per race.",
"Late Braking: Gain an advantage by braking later than your opponent into a corner. Move up one position but lose tire durability.",
"Slipstream Boost: Use the car ahead’s slipstream to gain speed on the straight. You can attempt to pass the car in front without rolling a die.",
"Pit Crew Radio Call: Coordinate a strategic call to your pit crew. Skip your turn to prepare for a faster pit stop, gaining a speed boost in the next two turns.",
"Engine Overload: Push the engine to its limit for a speed boost. Gain an extra move this turn, but your car suffers damage, reducing future performance.",
"Aerodynamic Upgrade: Install a new aerodynamic package. For the next two turns, your car gets a bonus on straight-line speed, allowing easier overtakes.",
"Tire Degradation: Your tires are wearing out! Skip your next turn to change tires, or risk continuing with reduced performance, making it harder to defend or overtake.",
"DRS Activation: Open your Drag Reduction System (DRS) to increase top speed. You can attempt an overtake with no penalty, but only if you are within one position of the car in front.",
"Mechanical Failure: A random malfunction affects your car! Lose one turn while fixing the issue in the pit, but gain a small repair bonus for the remainder of the race.",
"Safety Car Deployment: A safety car is on the track! All players must slow down for the next two turns. No overtakes are allowed, and positions remain frozen.",
"Rain on the Track: Unexpected rain begins! All players must switch to wet tires or suffer a significant speed penalty for the next three turns.",
"Red Flag: The race is temporarily stopped due to a major incident. All players lose one turn while the track is cleared, and positions remain the same.",
"Track Debris: Debris on the circuit causes chaos! The player in the lead loses a turn while their car undergoes a quick check in the pits.",
"Virtual Safety Car: The race slows down, but not fully stopped. All players must reduce their pace for one turn, but strategies and pit stops are still allowed.",
"Undercut Strategy: Pit earlier than your opponents to gain time with fresher tires. Skip a turn to change tires, then gain a bonus on overtaking for the next two turns.",
"Fuel Management: Conserve fuel to extend your race pace. Sacrifice speed for one turn, but in exchange, gain an extra move in the final two turns of the race.",
"Overcut Strategy: Stay on the track longer to gain track position. Delay your pit stop by one turn, risking tire wear, but if successful, you overtake one opponent when they pit.",
"Two-Stop Strategy: Commit to a more aggressive race strategy with two pit stops. Each stop gives you fresh tires, boosting your speed for three turns, but at the cost of losing track time.",
"Tire Gamble: Take a risk by choosing the wrong tires for current track conditions. Roll a die: if it’s high, you gain significant speed; if it’s low, you suffer a penalty for the next turn."];
