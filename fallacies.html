  const rulesOfAcquisition = [
    "Ad Hominem<br>Attacking the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself.<br>Example: You can't trust John's argument about climate change because he's not a scientist.",
"Strawman Argument<br>Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack.<br>Example: People who support space exploration want to waste money instead of fixing problems here on Earth.",
"Appeal to Ignorance (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam)<br>Claiming something is true because it hasn't been proven false (or vice versa).<br>Example: No one has proven that aliens don't exist, so they must be real.",
"False Dilemma (Either/Or Fallacy)<br>Presenting two options as the only possibilities, when there are more.<br>Example: You're either with us, or you're against us.",
"Slippery Slope<br>Arguing that a small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related events ending in disaster, without proof.<br>Example: If we allow students to redo this test, next they'll want to retake every test, and soon they'll be running the school.",
"Circular Reasoning (Begging the Question)<br>The argument assumes what it is trying to prove, effectively arguing in a circle.<br>Example: God exists because the Bible says so, and we know the Bible is true because it is the word of God.",
"Hasty Generalization<br>Making a broad generalization based on insufficient evidence.<br>Example: My friend got sick after eating sushi once, so sushi is unsafe.",
"Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (False Cause)<br>Assuming that because one thing followed another, it was caused by it.<br>Example: Since I started wearing my lucky socks, we've won every game. The socks must be causing our success.",
"Appeal to Authority (Argumentum ad Verecundiam)<br>Believing something is true just because an authority figure believes it, without examining the evidence.<br>Example: A famous actor uses this product, so it must be the best.",
"Red Herring<br>Introducing irrelevant material to distract from the argument at hand.<br>Example: Why worry about pollution when there are so many homeless people needing help?",
"Tu Quoque (You Too Fallacy)<br>Dismissing someone's argument because they themselves are inconsistent or hypocritical.<br>Example: You say smoking is unhealthy, but you used to smoke too!",
"Bandwagon Appeal (Ad Populum)<br>Assuming something is true or right because it's popular or because everyone is doing it.<br>Example: Everyone believes that this diet works, so it must be effective.",
"Appeal to Emotion (Argumentum ad Passiones)<br>Using emotions like fear, pity, or flattery rather than logical reasoning to persuade.<br>Example: Think of the children! We must ban all violent video games to protect them.",
"Appeal to Nature<br>Arguing that because something is natural, it is therefore inherently good or right.<br>Example: This medicine is made from natural ingredients, so it must be better than synthetic alternatives.",
"False Equivalence<br>Presenting two unlike things as if they are logically equivalent.<br>Example: Both murder and theft are crimes, so they're equally bad.",
"No True Scotsman<br>Defending a generalization by excluding counterexamples that don’t support it.<br>Example: No true Scotsman puts sugar in their porridge. Oh, he’s Scottish and puts sugar? Then he’s not a true Scotsman.",
"Gambler's Fallacy<br>Believing that past random events influence the likelihood of future random events.<br>Example: I've lost the last five coin flips, so the next one has to be heads.",
"Appeal to Tradition (Argumentum ad Antiquitatem)<br>Arguing that something is correct or better simply because it is traditional or has always been done that way.<br>Example: We’ve always done it this way, so it must be the best approach.",

"Equivocation (Ambiguity Fallacy)<br>Using a word with multiple meanings and switching between those meanings in the course of an argument.<br>Example: A feather is light. What is light cannot be dark. Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.",
"Middle Ground Fallacy<br>Assuming that the middle position between two extremes is always correct.<br>Example: Some people believe the Earth is flat, while others believe it's round. The truth must be somewhere in between.",

"Quoting Out of Context<br>Taking a quote out of its original context to distort the meaning of what was said.<br>Example: Einstein said, ‘God does not play dice with the universe,’ so he must have believed in a traditional God. (ignoring that this was a metaphor about quantum mechanics).",
"Sunk Cost Fallacy<br>Continuing an endeavor because of the time, effort, or money already invested, even if the current costs outweigh the benefits.<br>Example: I’ve already spent $500 fixing this old car. I might as well keep fixing it even if it's breaking down all the time.",
"Relative Privation (Appeal to Worse Problems)<br>Dismissing an issue or argument by comparing it to a more serious problem, even when both are valid concerns.<br>Example: Why are you worried about climate change when there are people starving in the world?",

"Definist Fallacy<br>Defining a term in a biased way that supports your argument while dismissing any other interpretations.<br>Example: Freedom means doing whatever I want, so any restriction is an attack on my freedom.",
"Fallacy of Relative Privation<br>Trying to dismiss a serious issue by comparing it to a more serious problem.<br>Example: Why worry about pollution when there are people starving?",

"Conjunction Fallacy<br>Assuming that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.<br>Example: It’s more likely that Linda is a bank teller and a feminist than just a bank teller. (In reality, the probability of both being true is less than one being true.)",

"Reductio ad Absurdum<br>Extending an argument to absurd lengths to show it is flawed or ridiculous.<br>Example: If we allow people to marry whoever they love, next they’ll want to marry their pets or robots.",
"Etymological Fallacy<br>Assuming that the original or historical meaning of a word is its true or correct meaning.<br>Example: The word ‘discipline’ comes from the Latin word for ‘teaching,’ so it can’t have any negative connotations.",
