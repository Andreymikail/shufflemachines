"The Quantum Zeno Paradox: Frequent observation of a quantum system can prevent it from evolving. This suggests that simply measuring a system can affect its state, a concept that defies classical intuition.",
"The Boltzmann Brain Paradox: In an infinite universe, self-aware entities could spontaneously form from random fluctuations. It's more probable for a single brain to form than the entire universe, raising questions about our own existence.",
